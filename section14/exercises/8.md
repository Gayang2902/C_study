Suppose we want a macro that expands into a string containing the current line number and 
file name. In other words, we'd like to write
const char *str = LINE_FILE; 
and have it expand into
const char *str = "Line 10 of file foo.c";
where foo.c is the file containing the program and 10 is the line on which the invocation
of LINE_FILE appears. Warming: This exercise is for experts only. Be sure to read the 
O&A section carefully before attempting!
