(a) Write a macro DISP (f, x) that expands into a call of printf that displays the value 
of the function f when called with argument x. For example.
DISP (sqrt, 3.0); should expand into
printf ("sqrt (%g) = %g\n", 3.0, sqrt (3.0));

--> #define DISP(f, x) (printf((#f) "(%g) = %g\n", (x), (f(x))))

(b) Write a macro DISP2 ( E , x , y) that's similar to DISP 
but works for functions with two arguments.

--> #define DISP2(E, x, y) (printf(#f"(%g, %g) = %g\n", (x), (y), (f((x)), (y)))))
